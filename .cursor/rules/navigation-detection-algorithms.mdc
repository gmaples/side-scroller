## Core Detection Components

### Pattern Recognition System
- Word boundary detection using `\b` regex boundaries for precise navigation element matching
- Context-aware phrase analysis differentiating between navigation terms ("next page") and generic terms ("more") 
- Multi-factor scoring combining pattern matches, penalties and bonuses
- Minimum threshold enforcement to prevent weak matches
- File: `content.js`

### Element Filtering Logic
- Position-based exclusions for browser UI zones (top 120px) and viewport edges
- Size constraints between 8x8px and 500x200px
- Z-index analysis for suspicious overlay elements
- Parent element context evaluation for browser UI detection
- File: `content.js`

### Navigation Element Scoring
- Pattern matching scores for navigation-related text and attributes
- Positional scoring based on element placement in viewport
- Size and visibility scoring
- Context penalties for browser UI elements
- Minimum threshold requirements
- File: `content.js`

### Dynamic Content Handling
- URL change detection with throttled updates
- Automatic rescanning on content mutations
- SPA navigation support
- Memory cleanup for event listeners and observers
- File: `content.js`

### Validation Test Suite  
- Browser UI filtering validation
- Element detection verification
- Position/size filtering tests
- Training mode validation
- Mock element creation and simulation
- Test result reporting
- File: `validate-extension.js`

Importance Scores:
- Pattern Recognition: 95 (Core detection algorithm)
- Element Filtering: 90 (Critical for accuracy)
- Navigation Scoring: 85 (Key decision logic)
- Dynamic Content: 80 (Essential for SPA support)
- Validation Suite: 75 (Quality assurance)
