# component-data-flow

The extension implements the following data flow patterns:

### Popup to Content Script Communication
- The popup interface (`popup.js`) sends messages to content scripts for:
  - Toggling training mode status
  - Refreshing navigation detection
  - Clearing stored training data
  - Enabling/disabling debug mode

### Content Script to Popup Status Updates
- Content scripts report extension status back to popup including:
  - Left/right arrow key binding status
  - Browser UI filter activation state
  - Training mode state
  - Navigation element detection results

### Extension Status Monitoring
- `test.html` continuously monitors extension status through:
  - Periodic checks for `smartNavigationBinder` presence
  - Event listeners for key binding changes
  - UI updates reflecting current extension state

### Dynamic Element Management
- Content scripts detect and process page changes:
  - Monitor DOM mutations for new navigation elements
  - Report changes back to popup interface
  - Update key bindings based on page content

### Training Mode Data Flow
- User-selected navigation elements in training mode:
  - Stored per-site in extension storage
  - Retrieved and applied when revisiting sites
  - Can be cleared through popup interface

### File Paths
- `popup.js`: Handles user interface interactions and messaging
- `popup.html`: Defines status display elements
- `test.html`: Implements extension monitoring
- `content.js`: Processes page content and handles navigation
